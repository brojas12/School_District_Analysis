# Module 4 Challenge – School District Analysis
## Overview of District Analysis
**#Purpose**

    The purpose of the analysis is to analyze student data regarding state-testing standards. However, due to evidence of 
    academic dishonesty on the math and reading scores for Thomas High School, we will replace the suspected data with NaNs 
    and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis. 
    
#  District Analysis Results

__How is the district summary affected?__

    Due to evidence supporting academic dishonesty the math and reading scores of 461 9th graders at Thomas High School were 
    replaced with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. When comparing the two charts, it can be observed that 
    replacing 461 test scores had a very marginal impact on the student data set. The change was less than a 1% difference.
